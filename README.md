# Sandpit
A repository for Unofficial Saltbox add ons, recipes, scripts and howto docs.

Sandpit is a work in progress and this isn't even its final form.

Sandpit is unsupported and may break your system, things _**should**_ work but they might not. It would be great to have docs for each submission but that may not always happen. Docs should probably just be included as a markdown file for now but we may enable the wiki on this repo. For now it won't be part of the official Saltbox documentation.

Sandpit will contain both docker compose and saltbox_mod recipes for now. That may change.

Things that don't really belong anywhere else within Saltbox belong here.

Please note that this is not an anything goes situation. There is a line that wont be crossed. Defining that line is yet to occur, but anything harmful and malicious is not welcome.
